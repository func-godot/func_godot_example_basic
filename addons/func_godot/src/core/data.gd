class_name FuncGodotData
## Container that holds various data structs to be used in the [FuncGodotMap] build process.
##
## FuncGodot utilizes multiple custom data structs to hold information parsed from the map file 
## and read and modified by the other core build classes. 
## All data structs extend from [RefCounted], therefore all data is passed by reference.
## [br][br]
## [FuncGodotData.FaceData][br]
## [FuncGodotData.BrushData][br]
## [FuncGodotData.PatchData][br]
## [FuncGodotData.GroupData][br]
## [FuncGodotData.EntityData][br]
