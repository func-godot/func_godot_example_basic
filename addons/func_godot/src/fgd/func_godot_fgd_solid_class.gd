class_name FuncGodotFGDSolidClass extends FuncGodotFGDEntityClass
## FGD SolidClass entity definition that generates a mesh from [FuncGodotData.BrushData].
##
## A [MeshInstance3D] will be generated by [FuncGodotMap] according to this definition's Visual Build settings. 
## If [member FuncGodotFGDEntityClass.node_class] inherits [CollisionObject3D] 
## then one or more [CollisionShape3D] nodes will be generated according to Collision Build settings.

@export_group("Mesh Metadata")
## Add a texture lookup table to the generated node's metadata on build.[br][br] 
## The data is split between an [Array] of [StringName] called [i]"texture_names"[/i] containing all currently used texture materials 
## and a [PackedInt32Array] called [i]"textures"[/i] where each element is an index corresponding to the [i]"texture_names"[/i] entries.
@export var add_textures_metadata: bool = false
## Add a [PackedVector3Array] called [i]"vertices"[/i] to the generated node's metadata on build.[br][br] 
## This is a list of every vertex in the generated node's [MeshInstance3D]. Every 3 vertices represent a single face.
@export var add_vertex_metadata: bool = false
## Add a [PackedVector3Array] called [i]"positions"[/i] to the generated node's metadata on build.[br][br] 
## This is a list of positions for each face, local to the generated node, calculated by averaging the vertices to find the face's center.
@export var add_face_position_metadata: bool = false
## Add a [PackedVector3Array] called [i]"normals"[/i] to the generated node's metadata on build.[br][br]

@export var add_face_normal_metadata: bool = false
## [s]Add a [Dictionary] called [i]"collision_shape_to_face_range_map"[/i] in the generated node's metadata on build.[br][br] 
## Contains keys of strings, which are the names of child [CollisionShape3D] nodes, and values of
## [Vector2i], where [i]X[/i] represents the starting index of that child's faces and [i]Y[/i] represents the
## ending index.[br][br]
## For example, an element of [br][br][code]{ "entity_1_brush_0_collision_shape" : Vector2i(0, 15) }[/code][br][br]
## shows that this solid class has been generated with one child collision shape named 
## [i]entity_1_brush_0_collision_shape[/i] which handles the first 15 faces of the parts of the mesh with collision.[/s]
